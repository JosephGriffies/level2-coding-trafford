    <H1>About me</H1>
    <p>Hello my name is Joseph and I am on this course to gain some new skills so I can consider a career in coding. I have a very limited coding experience which was mostly things I learnt from high school in gcse computer science. We primarily worked in python and our final task was to create a game where you rolled dice. Overall I found coding to be enjoyable however I don't remeember much from back then so I am hoping that this course can elevate my understanding of coding.</p>
